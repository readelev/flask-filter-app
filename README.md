# Flask Filter App


# Homework due Monday, May 16

Describe the two (or more, if you choose) views of your app:
* What is shown on the main listing page

My app will explore the FAA Wildlife Strike database. The homepage will have a brief explainer followed by the filter options (explained below) above a brief preview of the data (10-20 first few rows).

* Describe the filter options â€“ e.g. full text search of name, sort by a date field, a checkbox for 'M' or 'F', you will make available to the user.

Users can filter by date, airport, airline, or species.

* What is shown on the details page

The details page will show the filtered, sorted subset of data.

* List three actual live data applications (such as ones produced by the government, or by news sites) that inspired you.
