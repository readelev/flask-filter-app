# Flask Filter App

# Homework due Monday, May 16

*Describe the two (or more, if you choose) views of your app:*

My app will explore the FAA Wildlife Strike data for SFO. The homepage will have a brief explainer followed by the filter options (explained below) above a brief preview of the data (10-20 first few rows).

The details page will show the filtered, sorted subset of data.

*Describe the filter options you will make available to the user.*

Users can filter by airline or species.

*List three actual live data applications (such as ones produced by the government, or by news sites) that inspired you.*
